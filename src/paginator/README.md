Paginator
=========

The Paginator Control allows you to reduce the page size and render
  time of your site or web application by breaking up large data sets
  into discrete pages. Paginator addresses the navigation aspect of
  chunked content, offering a set of controls that it can render into
  your UI to allow users to navigate through logical sections of local
  or remote data.
